# **Fashion MNIST Classification with Artificial Neural Networks**


## Overview
Welcome to the repository for Fashion MNIST Classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This project demonstrates the complete process of building, training, evaluating, and testing an ANN for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The key steps include data preprocessing, model building, and visualizing both the dataset and the model's performance.

## Project Structure
fashion.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for loading the dataset, preprocessing, building, training, and evaluating the model, as well as visualizing the results.


README.md: Detailed documentation of the project, including setup instructions and explanations of the code.

## Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Normalizes and reshapes the dataset to prepare it for model training.


Visualizations: Includes visualizations for exploring the dataset, such as sample images and class distribution.


ANN Model: Builds a convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiple layers, including convolutional, pooling, and dense layers


Model Training and Evaluation: Compiles and trains the model, and provides visualizations of training and validation accuracy and loss.


Test Set Predictions: Uses the trained model to make predictions on the test set and displays sample predictions with images.

## Results
The trained model achieves a test accuracy of approximately 90%. The repository includes visualizations to help understand the model's performance and the distribution of the dataset.
